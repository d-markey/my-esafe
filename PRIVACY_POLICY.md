**My eSafe - PRIVACY POLICY**

My eSafe is a free offline application for managing private data. It does not require network access to function and does not send data to any distant server for storage. Instead, data is encrypted and stored locally on the user's device, protected by a user-defined password, and is never transmitted over the network. Encryption services are provided by [Pointy Castle](https://pub.dev/packages/pointycastle)'s [AESEngine](https://pub.dev/documentation/pointycastle/latest/impl.block_cipher.aes/AESEngine-class.html).

My eSafe does not collect nor share any personal data.

My eSafe includes ads that are displayed when the device is online and the application is active. The ad service is provided via [Google Mobile Ads for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads). My eSafe is configured to serve non-personalized ads.
