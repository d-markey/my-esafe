My eSafe is a free, offline application for managing private data. It does not require network access to function and does not send data to any distant server for storage: instead, data is encrypted and stored locally on the user's device. It is never transmitted over the network.

However, My eSafe includes ads that are displayed when the device is online. This service is provided via [Google Mobile Ads for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mobile_ads). My eSafe is configured to serve non-personalized ads.
